    <strong>About Me:</strong>

    <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">
        A computer science graduate and a software developer. With over seven years of experience as a developer, I have
        worked independently and with teams and gained a good knowledge of programming languages and the software
        development life cycle. I love writing well-organized and clean code. I enjoy refactoring code to make things
        more clear and easily maintainable. I am always open to feeDBack and never miss a chance to give ideas to
        improve the status quo. I love everything about learning new things and have no attachment to any framework,
        language, etc. To sum it up, an enthusiast learner, a neat coder, a helpful team-worker, and a stubborn problem
        solver with a great sense and flexibility.
